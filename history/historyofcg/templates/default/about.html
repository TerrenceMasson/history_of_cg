                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">This site aims to be the first comprehensive source of Computer
                            Graphics history and information. Our goal is to catalog original stories about the
                            projects, people, events, and organizations that make up the collective history
                            of the field. To do so, weâ€™ve reached out to key players who have contributed to the
                            development of computer graphics over the last 50 years, to share their experiences and
                            knowledge of the events and developments that have brought computer graphics to where
                            they are today.
                            <br><br>
                            In such a rapidly developing field, we believe that this history will be best told by
                            the people that participate in it. The History of CG database allows users to freely
                            explore and add to the content of our site, capturing the rich and diverse history of
                            this exciting field. </p>

                        <p>Our content is regularly reviewed by SIGGRAPH Pioneers, to ensure accuracy and
                            encourage relevant and complete entries.

                            The available online sources about compter graphics history are fragmented, incomplete
                            and deal with basic facts. Our project focuses on the personal stories and connections
                            between the people behind the pixels.</p>
